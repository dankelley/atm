# atm 0.0.2

* Update the University of Whyoming website links.
* Change `stationNumber()` to default to listing possibilities. Note: when last
  I checked, there were several sites in Nova Scotia, but the University of
  Wyoming map webpage now only shows one, at Yarmouth.
* Change `summary()` to display all the metadata for the object (issue #9).

# atm 0.0.1

* In rapid development, with features being added and changed without altering
  the version number.
