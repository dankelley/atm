The `atm` package provides R functions for dealing with atmospheric
properties. It is *very* preliminary, and function names and actions may change
a lot at any moment.

Please note that this package is designed to work with files provided
via the GUI at a University of Wyoming server (Reference 1) and key
functions will fail if that server changes its URL structure or the
format of the files it provides.

and 3.
