\title{Compute air potential temperature from in-situ temperature}
\usage{
T2theta(temperature, pressure, Rd = 287.04, Cp = 1005.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{temperature}{numeric value indicating in-situ temperature in
degrees C.}

\item{pressure}{numeric value indicating pressure in mbar (equivalently,
in hPa).}

\item{Rd, Cp}{dry-air gas constant and mass-specific heat capacity,
with the default values as in Reference 2.}
}
\value{
\code{T2theta} returns potential temperature, in degrees Celcius.
}
\description{
Potential temperature is computed as in Chapter 3 of Reference 1, i.e. by
dividing the in-situ temperature by the ratio of actual pressure to reference
pressure, raised to the power \code{Rd}/\code{Cp}. (The computation is done in Absolute
Temperature, with conversions to and from Celcius being done with \code{\link[=TK2TC]{TK2TC()}}
and \code{\link[=TC2TK]{TC2TK()}}, respectively.)  See also \code{\link[=theta2T]{theta2T()}}, which is the inverse
of \code{T2theta()}.
